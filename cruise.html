<h1>1. Carnival Cruise Line</h1>

    <p>Carnival's website offers a welcoming design and, arguably, the industry's most<br> user-friendly layout. 
        It's a virtual treasure trove of information, offering easy-to-find <br>details on destinations and ports (including departure cities); 
        onboard activities, entertainment,<br> bars and restaurants (including which ships have them); cabins (along with easy-to-read deck plans); <br>
        and shore excursions (organized by either destination or activity type)
        When it comes to finding the <br>sailing that's right for you, it's as easy as choosing where you want to go, 
        where you'd like to depart<br> and when, 
        and for how long you want to be gone. 
        You can also choose to drill down further by employing <br>filters like price, ship and number of people in your party.
        Carnival's website makes it easy to figure out<br> exactly which ships have which amenities and activities so you can pick a vessel that's right for you and your <br>travel companions.

<h1>2. Disney Cruise Line</h1>

        <p>We'd expect nothing less from The Mouse than a functional and visually appealing <br>website, and Disney Cruise Line's doesn't disappoint. 
            From the drop-downs at the <br>
            top of the homepage, you can easily access information about ships and their recent<br> upgrades, 
            themed sailings, things to do onboard, destinations, shore excursions and <br>pre- and post-cruise stays.

            Once the crisp and colorful videos convince you it's time to<br> book, you can easily find your ideal voyage by choosing dates, a destination, cruise length <br>and the number of passengers.
            
            Despite the hefty price tags attached to Disney Cruises, <br>not everything is included in the fares. Because of that, we find Disney's "What's Included" <br>section to be helpful in letting potential cruisers know, up front, what they get for their money.</p>
